Any changes where will go live and affect the new account settings of all

Given that this is a plain file repository, not a database, each
email address domain must have a file here. Many providers have several
email address domains. In this case, please copy the file using "svn cp".
This will lead to lots of duplicate data, so we have to - for now -
manually make sure that they are in sync. You can see find the other copies
by looking into the file: the <emailProvider id=""> contains the
main domain, and that's also the main / authorative configuration file.
All other domains are listed in <domain> underneath, and all corresponding
files are just copies of the main file.

Mid-term, we should have a small database (with simple web frontend) do that.
For the record, using plain files and svn was not my idea, so don't yell at
me :).
