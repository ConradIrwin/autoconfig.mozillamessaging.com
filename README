Alternative configurations

Some ISPs / providers have different kinds of users underneath the
same domain, e.g. allows IMAP only for users who pay more.
Another case is when a provider requires different configurations
depending on situation: E.g. one only works within their ISP network,
others only work in their hotspots etc.pp..

In these cases, we'll create one file for each config alternative, with
filename domain, space, reason, e.g. "gmx.de" and "gmx.de pay". Because
TB3 does not requests domains with a space, these alternative configs are
effectively inactive.

This problem would of course be much easier with a database.
